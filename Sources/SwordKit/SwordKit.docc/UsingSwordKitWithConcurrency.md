# Using SwordKit with Concurrency

Share live libraries safely and move immutable Scripture values through actors,
tasks, and UI models.

## Share live engine services

``SwordLibrary`` and ``SwordModule`` are `Sendable`. A library synchronizes
refresh and module snapshots, while each module serializes access to its own
native cursor, parsing, rendering, and search state.

```swift
actor ScriptureService {
    let library: SwordLibrary

    init(location: SwordModuleLocation) throws {
        library = try SwordLibrary(location: location)
    }

    func verse(_ reference: String, module name: String) throws -> SwordVerse {
        guard let module = library.module(named: name) else {
            throw SwordError.moduleNotFound(name)
        }

        return try module.verse(reference)
    }
}
```

An actor can still be useful for application state or policy even though SwordKit
protects native state internally.

## Understand serialization

Operations against the same module wait for one another. Different modules can
perform work independently. For maximum parallelism across long searches, use
separate module objects rather than sending several operations to one module.

The library's ``SwordLibrary/modules`` property returns a stable array snapshot.
Refreshing does not invalidate immutable values already returned to callers.

## Use asynchronous APIs for cancellation

`SwordModule.searchAsync(_:type:caseSensitive:scope:progress:)`,
`SwordModule.versesAsync(in:)`, and
`SwordLibrary.parallelPassageAsync(_:modules:)` check structured cancellation.
Native search also receives an explicit termination signal.

```swift
let task = Task {
    try await bible.searchAsync("grace", caseSensitive: false)
}

task.cancel()
```

## Stream search results

`SwordModule.searchStream(_:type:caseSensitive:scope:progress:)` adapts SWORD's
batch results to an `AsyncSequence`. Ending iteration cancels its producer:

```swift
for try await result in bible.searchStream("grace") {
    if shouldStop {
        break
    }

    consume(result)
}
```

Keep progress callbacks lightweight and `Sendable`; dispatch product-specific UI
state back to the main actor.
